// I've provided some pretty granular information about the exact phase of the Pocketsphinx listening loop, the Audio Session, and Flite, but I'd expect 
// that the ones that will really be needed by most projects are the following:
//
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis:(NSString *)hypothesis recognitionScore:(NSString *)recognitionScore utteranceID:(NSString *)utteranceID;

#pragma mark Example for reading out Pocketsphinx and Flite audio levels without locking the UI by using an NSTimer

// What follows are not OpenEars methods, just an approach for level reading
// that I've included with this sample app. My example implementation does make use of two OpenEars
// methods:	the pocketsphinxInputLevel method of OEPocketsphinxController and the fliteOutputLevel
// method of OEFliteController. 
//
// The example is meant to show one way that you can read those levels continuously without locking the UI, 
// by using an NSTimer, but the OpenEars level-reading methods 
// themselves do not include multithreading code since I believe that you will want to design your own 
// code approaches for level display that are tightly-integrated with your interaction design and the  
// graphics API you choose. 
// 
// Please note that if you use my sample approach, you should pay attention to the way that the timer is always stopped in
// dealloc. This should prevent you from having any difficulties with deallocating a class due to a running NSTimer process.
