Add the following to your implementation (the .m file):

Before you call a method of either OEFliteController or OEPocketsphinxController (perhaps in viewDidLoad), instantiate OEEventsObserver and set its delegate as follows:

<pre>
self.openEarsEventsObserver = [[OEEventsObserver alloc] init];
[self.openEarsEventsObserver setDelegate:self];
</pre>
