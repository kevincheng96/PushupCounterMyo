OEEventsObserver is the class which keeps you continuously updated about the status of your listening session, among other things, via delegate callbacks.

Add the following lines to your header (the .h file). Under the imports at the very top:
<pre>
#import &lt;OpenEars/OEEventsObserver.h&gt;
</pre>
at the @interface declaration, add the OEEventsObserverDelegate inheritance. 

An example of this for a view controller called ViewController would look like this:
<pre>
@interface ViewController : UIViewController &lt;OEEventsObserverDelegate&gt
</pre>
And add this property to your other class properties (OEEventsObserver must be a property of your class or it will not work):
<pre>
@property (strong, nonatomic) OEEventsObserver *openEarsEventsObserver;
</pre>
